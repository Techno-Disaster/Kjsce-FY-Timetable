## How to use the app?

1) Select the day you want to see the timetable of or want to plan a bunk.
2) Initially all the switches are turned on. So all the lectures are counted as attended. Turn off the switches that you are planning to bunk. 
3) Go to the Attendance Page. There you will be able to Checkout your attendance ***Till The Selected Day*** on the first page.
4) **For Example**, If you want to check your attendance till **Today**, select Today's Date(It is selected by default when you open the app.) and then go to the Attendance Page. If you want to plan your attendance for future say upto  **X**, select that day, Turn off the switches you want to bunk between Initially Day(1st July, 2019) and **X** and then go to the Attendance Page.
5) **Some Important pointers**
    * Initial Date is that of Sem Starting that is 1st July,2019.
    * End Date is that of Sem Ending that is 16th October, 2019.
    * Attendance on Public Holidays marked by **Red** Colour wont' be counted.
    * You can operate the Calendar in **Three** Modes. ***Week, Two Weeks and Month***
    * There are no lectures on weekend. So the App has been designed in that way. So ignore special days of attendance.
    * ***Practical Lecture*** consists of **Two Lectures**. So incase of Practical Lectures, Two Switches are inter-related.
    * This App for now will work only For 1st Sem ExTc E Students because of Hard-Coded TimeTable. In future, it may be available for all.
    *  This is app is in ***Beta*** stages for now. However I haven't faced any bugs so far. If you face any, Report me on [Telegram](https://t.me/techno_disaster).
